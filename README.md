## Overview

<div align="center">
  <img width="1364" height="1024" alt="market" src="./img/main.png" />

  <i>Our method performs lightweight test-time optimization (≈0.419 s/image) without requiring any dataset-level training.It generalizes seamlessly across domains while maintaining consistent reconstruction quality for every image. (All examples are randomly selected, without cherry-picking.)</i>

### Simple usage, similar to OpenCV’s `cv2.resize`

```python

img_path = "sample.png"
img = Image.open(img_path).convert("RGB").resize((224, 224), Image.BICUBIC) # <- Any Target Size
lr_feature = dinov2_infer(img_path) # <- any low resolution modalities (e.g. depth, Probability map, feature map)
hr_feature = UPA(img, lr_feature) 
```
